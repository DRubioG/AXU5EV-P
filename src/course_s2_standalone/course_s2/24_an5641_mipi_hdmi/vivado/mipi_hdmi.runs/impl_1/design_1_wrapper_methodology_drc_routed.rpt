2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on mipi_phy_if_data_n[0] relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on mipi_phy_if_data_n[1] relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on mipi_phy_if_data_p[0] relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on mipi_phy_if_data_p[1] relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-40#1 Advisory
Substitute PLLE4 for MMCME4 check  
The MMCME4 cell design_1_i/axi_dynclk_0/U0/Inst_mmcme2_drp/mmcm_adv_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, UNKNOWN, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell design_1_i/axi_dynclk_0/U0/Inst_mmcme2_drp/mmcm_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) design_1_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/inst/pl_clk2_BUFG_inst and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-58#1 Advisory
PLLE4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The PLLE4_ADV cell design_1_i/mipi_csi2_rx_subsyst_0/inst/phy/inst/inst/bd_d10d_phy_0_rx_support_i/slave_rx.bd_d10d_phy_0_rx_hssio_i/inst/top_inst/clk_rst_top_inst/clk_scheme_inst/GEN_PLL_IN_IP_USP.plle4_adv_pll0_inst CLKIN pin is driven by global Clock buffer design_1_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/inst/pl_clk1_BUFG_inst and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the PLL and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net driven by the global Clock buffer.
Related violations: <none>
